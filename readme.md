The purpose of this code is to take a json file generated from [Discord Chat Exporter](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/DiscordChatExporter) and determine how many people have ended the count to 1000. and also generate a high score for each person.

The high score is the sum of the last highest number we were up to before that person ended the count.

To use this enter your own json file from the chat exporter and modify the `FILENAME` variable in `main.py`
